1) quick user guide 

- The plugin appears individually in the toolbox and is named 'Leave one out Validation'
- There you can choose your interpolation method from the ones included in the plugin in the drop down menu
- fill in all the fields in the appearing GUI 
    - IMPORTANT: while using SAGA interpolation methods your interpolation result must be saved as a temporary file or as a .sdat file --> so make sure that your file is one of the two
    - !! Have the python console opened so you can keep track of the progress and see all the documentation for every step of the validation
    - the parameters you have to define depend on the interpolation method you chose
- the two important outputs are the interpolation result (see above) and the text file of the validation results
    - interpolation result: that's the interpolated surface for the whole data set - the result is the same as if you would have used the corresponding SAGA method
    - validation textfile: contains information about your interpolation in the first 2 lines and the validation results as a data table starting in line 3
    - use of textfile: you can import it as a layer in QGIS itself (starting from line 3) and use it calculation software to handle the data and calculate statistic values from the residues like ME (mean error) or RMSE (rooted mean squared error)
    - information about data: if a data point is not validated the number in the delta field is 999999.999, reasons may vary but some interpolation methods, such a cubic spline interpolation, cant validate every data point inherently

2) quicker/tipps for the use of the plugin

- open the python console in QGIS while running the plugin to properly see the progress. At the same time this is used to document all the created geodatafiles. SO with this in information you can check if everything went as intended.
- always check, that you actively define the output for the interpolated raster. Becuase SAGA modules result in .sdat files, you either have to actively define that you want to save it as a temporary file or define your output directory with the data file ending. sdat.
- The number 999999.999 in the delta field represents that there was no value to calculate. That means that the data point that was removed was not in the interpolated area of the validation. Therefore no residue value (delta) can be calculated. It was the choice to assign the value 999999.999 instead of a string 'NaN - data point not in the interpolated area', because it makes it easier to import the resulting .txt file into QGIS afterwards. This means with the value, the import will instantly be a number instead of a string field. Therefore it's faster to process with the data afterwards.
- generally keep in mind that NaN values can result because of the way the inteprolation works. For example, cubic spline defines the extent of their interpolation through the data put into the interpolation. That means, that validation of data points at the edge of the data set may result in an interpolation validation raster shape that might not include the removed data point. Therefore a residue is not calculatable.

3) information about the leave one out method

he leave one out method is used to validate the accuracy of interpolations. Reading through literature, one also encounters the terms cross validation and jackknifing. Many times the term cross validation is used when desrcibing and using the metod of this plugin in scientific papers. Because of potential condusion between the widely used terms of cross validation and jackknifing this plugin is only names as leave one out method because this describes the method in its core the best. The last section features some publications that were read through while getting into the topic a bit more. This plugin offers algorithms to run and validate different deterministic interpolation methods of QGIS with the leave one out method. 

Therefore the code runs the interpolation method for the whole data set and afterwards does the validation. Resulting, the user gets a text file with the relevant validation data. During the leave one out validation one data point of the input data is removed. Afterwards the interpolation is used on the resulting data with the same parameters. The interpolation result of the validation step is compared to the known, true value of the removed data point. This difference in estimated value and true value (residue) is saved to the validation text file. This procedure is repeated until all data points are validated once. The resulting text file then contains general information about the interpolation method, their parameters, the first column of the attribute rable of the data to associate the data to the input shapefile, the coordinates of the validated point feature as well as the true value, the estimated value of the validation interpolation and the residue.

The user can use the resulting validation residues to calculate statistic parameters like the RMSE to judge the accuracy of the interpolation. At the same time the text file can be used to add the data to QGIS again.
